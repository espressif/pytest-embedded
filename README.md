# pytest-embedded [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.com/projects/espressif-pytest-embedded/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/?badge=latest)

A pytest plugin that has multiple services available for various functionalities. Designed for the embedded testing.

## Installation

All packages are published to PyPI. Please install them with `pip`.

## Design Philosophy

### Fixtures

Each test case would initialize a few fixtures. The most important fixtures are:

- `pexpect_proc`, a pexpect process, that could run `pexpect.expect()` for testing purpose.
- `app`, the built binary
- `dut`, a "Device under test" (DUT) test unit.

    A DUT would contain several processes. The output of each process would be redirected to `pexpect_proc` and logged by `logging.info()`.

### Services

Activate a service would enable a set of fixtures or add some extra functionalities to a few fixtures. You can activate comma-separated services by `pytest --embedded-services`. For detailed information, please refer to the `embedded` group of the `pytest --help`.

Available services:

- `serial`: serial port utilities.
- `esp`: auto-detect target/port by esptool.
- `idf`: auto-detect more app info with idf specific rules, auto-flash the binary into the target.
- `jtag`: openocd/gdb utilities
- `qemu`: running test cases on QEMU instead of the real target.

### Multi DUTs

Sometimes we need multi DUTs while testing, e.g., master-slave or mesh testing.

Here are a few examples of how to enable this. For detailed information, please refer to the `embedded` group of the `pytest --help`.

1. We can enable multi DUTs by specifying `--count`. In this way, all the fixtures would be a tuple with instances. Each configuration will use `|` as a separator for each instance.

```shell
pytest \
--embedded-services serial|serial \
--count 2 \
--app-path <master_bin>|<slave_bin>
```

In this example, `app` would be a tuple of 2 `App` instances, `dut` would be a tuple of 2 `Dut` Instances.

You can test with:

```python
def test(dut):
    master = dut[0]
    slave = dut[1]

    master.expect('sent')
    slave.expect('received')
```

3. The configuration could have only one value when this value is applying to all DUTs.

```shell
pytest \
--embedded-services serial \
--count 2 \
--app-path <master_bin>|<slave_bin> \
```

`--embedded-services serial` would apply to all DUTs

4. The configuration could be vacant if this value is only useful for certain DUTs.

```shell
pytest \
--embedded-services qemu|serial \
--count 2 \
--app-path <master_bin>|<slave_bin> \
--qemu-cli-args "<args>|" \
--port "|<port>" \
```

`--qemu-cli-args` would apply to the first DUT and `--port` would apply to the second DUT.

### Parametrizing

All the CLI options support parametrizing via `indirect=True`. Parametrizing is a feature provided by `pytest`, please refer to [Parametrizing tests](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/parametrize.html) for its documentation.

In order to support multi DUT and parametrizing, we use string to represent bool value. "y/yes/true" for `True` and "n/no/false" for `False`, case-insensitive.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'embedded_service,app_path',
    [
        ('idf', app_path_1),
        ('idf', app_path_2),
    ],
    indirect=True,
)
def test_serial_tcp(dut):
    assert dut.app.target == 'esp32'
    dut.expect('Restart now')
```

### Logging

Since all the output of each process would be duplicated with `logging.info()`, we recommend using pytest logging functionalities for the best user experience.

For the configuration of pytest logging, please refer to [pytest documentation: Live Logs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/logging.html#live-logs)

Here's a simple example of a configuration file that logs to the console and the file simultaneously.

```ini
[pytest]
log_auto_indent = True

log_cli = True
log_cli_level = INFO
log_cli_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
log_cli_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

log_file = test.log
log_file_level = INFO
log_file_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s
log_file_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
```

### Expecting

We support `expect`, `expect_exact`, and `expect_list` to assert if one string or pattern exists.

These three functions are supported via `pexpect` same name function, but the return value is slightly different in `pytest-embedded`.

```python
def test_something(dut, redirect, pexpect_proc):
    with redirect():
        print('foo bar baz qux')  # write "foo bar baz qux" to the buffer

    res = dut.expect('foo')
    # res = dut.expect('f[o]{2}')  # could be a pattern
    # res = dut.expect(re.compile(b'foo'))  # could be a compiled regex for bytes

    # `expect` would return a `re.Match` object if matched successfully
    # don't forget to decode, sync they're actually bytes in the buffer
    logging.info(f'The first word is [{res.group().decode("utf8")}]')
    # >>> The first word is [foo]

    # `expect_exact` would do a string compare, and return the matched bytes if matched successfully
    res = dut.expect_exact(['nonsense1', 'bar', 'nonsense2'])
    logging.info(f'The second word is [{res.decode("utf8")}]')
    # >>> The second word is [bar]

    # `expect_list` would use compiled regex as argument
    # please note that we should use bytes pattern here, since they are actually bytes in the buffer
    res = dut.expect_list([re.compile(b'nonsense1'), re.compile(b'baz'), re.compile(b'nonsense2')])
    logging.info(f'The third word is [{res.group().decode("utf8")}]')
    # >>> The third word is [baz]

    # `expect` a `pexpect.EOF` would get all the remaining buffers
    pexpect_proc.terminate()  # to terminate the pexpect process and generate an EOF
    res = dut.expect(pexpect.EOF, timeout=None)
    logging.info(f'The forth word is [{res.decode("utf8")}], with an extra space')
    # >>> The forth word is [ qux], with an extra space
```
